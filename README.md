# Loan_Delinquency_Prediction
The aim of the project was to visualize the relationships between Loan Delinquency against other attributes in the dataset and build a Logistic Regression Model to predict the Loan Delinquency by a given customer. Tidied and transformed the dataset. Later, we used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot visualizations between various variables. Further, we combined census data with the original data to plot spatial visualizations using ‘sf’ library.  Deployed three classification models with XGboost, Random Forest and Gaussian Naïve Bayes for Model Evaluation. The Gaussian Naive Bayes model gave the best accuracy (89.93%) on the testing dataset.
